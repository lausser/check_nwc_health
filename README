How to "compile" the check_nwc_health script.
--------------------------------------------------------

1) Run the configure script to initialize variables and create a Makefile, etc.

	./configure --prefix=BASEDIRECTORY --with-nagios-user=SOMEUSER --with-nagios-group=SOMEGROUP --with-perl=PATH_TO_PERL

   a) Replace BASEDIRECTORY with the path of the directory under which Nagios
      is installed (default is '/usr/local/nagios')
   b) Replace SOMEUSER with the name of a user on your system that will be
      assigned permissions to the installed plugins (default is 'nagios')
   c) Replace SOMEGRP with the name of a group on your system that will be
      assigned permissions to the installed plugins (default is 'nagios')
   d) Replace PATH_TO_PERL with the path where a perl binary can be found.
      Besides the system wide perl you might have installed a private perl
      just for the nagios plugins (default is the perl in your path).


2) "Compile" the plugin with the following command:

	make

    This will produce a "check_nwc_health" script. You will also find
    a "check_nwc_health.pl" which you better ignore. It is the base for
    the compilation filled with placeholders. These will be replaced during
    the make process.


3) Install the compiled plugin script with the following command:

	make install

   The installation procedure will attempt to place the plugin in a 
   'libexec/' subdirectory in the base directory you specified with
   the --prefix argument to the configure script.


4) Verify that your configuration files for Nagios contains
   the correct paths to the new plugin.
